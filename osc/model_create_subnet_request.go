 * 3DS OUTSCALE API
 *
 * Welcome to the OUTSCALE API documentation.<br /> The OUTSCALE API enables you to manage your resources in the OUTSCALE Cloud. This documentation describes the different actions available along with code examples.<br /><br /> You can learn more about errors returned by the API in the dedicated [errors page](api/errors).<br /><br /> Note that the OUTSCALE Cloud is compatible with Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs, but there are [differences in resource names](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/OUTSCALE-APIs-Reference.html) between AWS and the OUTSCALE API.<br /> You can also manage your resources using the [Cockpit](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Cockpit.html) web interface.<br /><br /> An OpenAPI description of the OUTSCALE API is also available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/outscale/osc-api).

	// If true, checks whether you have the required permissions to perform the action.
	DryRun bool `json:"DryRun,omitempty"`
	// The IP range in the Subnet, in CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).<br /> The IP range of the Subnet can be either the same as the Net one if you create only a single Subnet in this Net, or a subset of the Net one. In case of several Subnets in a Net, their IP ranges must not overlap. The smallest Subnet you can create uses a /29 netmask (eight IPs). For more information, see [About VPCs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-VPCs.html).
	IpRange string `json:"IpRange"`
	// The ID of the Net for which you want to create a Subnet.
	NetId string `json:"NetId"`
	// The name of the Subregion in which you want to create the Subnet.
	SubregionName string `json:"SubregionName,omitempty"`
